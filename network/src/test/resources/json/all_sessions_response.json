Each of these above listed approaches come with their own drawbacks and as a result, third party approaches have also been tried. RxJava, which is the most popular of these libraries, while it does a good job in scheduling operations in the background, switching threads and composing operations, it comes with a major drawback which is its steep learning curve.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Kotlin and its increase popularity in Android application development, provides us with yet another option for running background operations with coroutines.  In this talk, we will be learning about what coroutines are, why coroutines and how to use them in android applications.\r\n",
